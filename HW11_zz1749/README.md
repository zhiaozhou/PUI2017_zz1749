# HOMEWORK 11 for NYU CUSP PUI2017


**Assignment 1 :**

- I clustered the business pattern using KMeans and Agglomerative clustering and made plots of business pattern time seires with the cluster centers and cloropleth of cluster centers for n (in 2 to 9) k-means clusters of business patterns (number of businesses) at the zipcode level for NYC zipcodes.


**Assignment 2 :**

- I added a loop to optimize the clustering and rendering it as an animation within the notebook.
