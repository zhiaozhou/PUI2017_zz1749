## Here you could find my HW8 for NYU CUSP PUI2017
## Basically I made a plot of relationships between Site EUI and CO2 emissions for residential buildings using LL84 2016 datasets as belows

## Figure. associations between Site EUI and CO2 emissions for residential buildings in NYC

##Comments/Feedback (Jack Lundquist, HW9)

First of all, great plot! The linear relationship clearly comes across, the figure size is nice, the axes are clearly labeled with units and it does not seem cluttered at all. I have 3 pieces of feedback that I think would help make the plot even better than it already is:

1. The red / blue color scheme can be a hard to distinguish between in some color-blind schemas, although the line vs. point shape distinction still allows the line and the scatter-plot to come out as different.

2. Even though the plot clearly communicates the linear relationship between EUI and GHGe, a caption explaining it in more detail would help. Furthermore, including the fact that buildings being examined are residential in the title would help clarify things, even if it is clear based on your title in the readme.

3. Is the bottom left corner the 0 point for both axes? It looks like it cuts off a bit earlier than 0 for the y-axis, which is a little confusing.

Overall, though, great job! The figure was very simple, clear and communicated the analytic insight easily.
