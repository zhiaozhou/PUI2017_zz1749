**CLARITY**  
Both figure one and figure two are easy to read as they clearly show people trends of the absolute numbers of crimes and the ratio of that number over the number of year 2010 per year by borough with scatter points and lines. However, I think a translucent grid would be better added in both of them as now people could find it hard to see the absolute value of each point. In addition, in Figure one, as the scale is very big from 0 to 60000 in a short axis, some small changes would be hardly noticed though this is solved in figure 2.
 
**AESTHETHIC**  
The colors are chosen appropiately in both two figures which allow me to focus on the right elements and the labels, title and legends are placed and set beautifully. And by the way, I don't treat color blindness as a problem here since there are so many different kinds of color blindness which all bring to respective difficulty recognizing certain kinds of colors and in order for this, there are already certain softwares or mobile applications that help people with them. 

# FBB color blindness remains a significant problem in visualization. there is a lot of literature about it. Consider that those apps are not available on the printed page, in a presentation where this chart would be displayes on a screen. and may not be available to the user on their device. Not addressing issues that affect diversely able people is also non-inclusive. Brushing it off as something that the diversly-able person can deal with themselves is exclusive. I have a big ethical issue with this statement 

**the colors are NOT color blind copliant: manhattan and bronx are indistinguishable to the most common color blindness, and so are staten island and queens . Different symbols would help but they dont in this case cause they are too small to beeasily distinguishable**


**the points are joined by a line. That is ok in this case cause the points are so small that continuity would be lost otherwise. but why are the lines dashed? they are all the same anyways, and the dashes contribute to the distraction.**



**HONESTY**  
Figure one and figure two show people the trend of how numbers of crimes was being declined over years by borough. However, there is a problem that people could easily compare these numbers and say some boroughs are more dangerous than the others. This is not true since a area with bigger population would tend to have more crimes. So here I would suggest use crime rates instead of absolute numbers of crimes which would reduce the impact of population.

## FBB
You also missed that :

labels way too small, tick marks way too small, legend tiny , why so much white space! 

on the top plot, what does "crime across year" mean? crime PER year, but that is unnecessary cause the year is the x axis already. so the y label could just be Total number of crimes (and dont need to say by borough cause the legend says that) The x label, wjy does it sayt year (2000-2016)? the range of the axis is obvious by the tick labels themselves.

The second plot is mistakenly described as "w respect to 2010" but it is "w respect to 2000"

# FBB please consider being inclusive rather than ablist in your scientific career

8/10
